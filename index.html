            <p>Somebody once told me
                The world is gonna roll me
                I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
                She was looking kind of dumb
                With her finger and her thumb
                In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
                Well, the years start coming
                And they don't stop coming
                Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
                So much to do, so much to see
                So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                You'll never know if you don't go
                You'll never shine if you don't glow
                Hey now, you're an all star
                Get your game on, go play
                Hey now, you're a rock star
                Get the show on, get paid
                And all that glitters is gold
                Only shooting stars break the mold
                It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
                You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
                But the meteor men beg to differ
                Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
                The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
                The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
                My world's on fire, how about yours?
                That's the way I like it and I never get bored
                Hey now, you're an all star
                Get your game on, go play
                Hey now, you're a rock star
                Get the show on, get paid
                All that glitters is gold
                Only shooting stars break the mold

                Hey now, you're a rock star
                Get the show on, get paid
                And all that glitters is gold
                Only shooting stars
                Somebody once asked
                "Could I spare some change for gas?
                I need to get myself away from this place"
                I said, "Yep, what a concept
                I could use a little fuel myself"
                And we could all use a little change
                Well, the years start coming
                And they don't stop coming
                Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
                So much to do, so much to see
                So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
                You'll never shine if you don't glow
                Hey now, you're an all star
                Get your game on, go play

Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.
